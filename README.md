- **Iterable** is the base Interface of the Collections framework. The main functionality of this interface is to provide an iterator for the collections. This interface contains only one abstract method which is the **iterator().**
- The **Collection** interface extends the Iterable interface and is implemented by all the classes in the collections framework. This interface gives you basic functionality to perform operations on collections like insert, update, delete, size, etc.
- Mainly Three Interfaces extend the Collection interface namely List, Set, Map. All interfaces have their own usage and advantages.
-  **ArrayList, LinkedList, Stack, and Vector** are the classes that implements the List interface. They also have their own advantages and functionalities.
- **HashSet, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet** are the classes that implements the Set interface. These classes also have their own advantages and functionalities.
